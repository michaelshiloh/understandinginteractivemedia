## Course Description

This seminar course is an introduction to the concepts, questions, and
components  that encompass interactive media as it relates to creative
expression and critical  engagement. Students will learn to analyze
interactive media’s constituent parts,  engage in readings that critically
examine both the impact that interactive media and  technology have on culture
and societies as well as the ways in which social  contexts shape the
development and application of these technologies, and apply  these concepts
in a series of creative exercises. The contexts become apparent by  examining
interactive media through the lenses of historic and contemporary critical
and curatorial perspectives. Throughout the semester students will learn and
apply  critical texts to analyze interactive media and build a vocabulary for
making sense of  our increasingly mediated world. The course thus serves to
introduce a conceptual foundation for students to inform and direct their own
creative practice by  establishing a lexicon of basic operating definitions
and reinforcing a culture of  makers capable of critical reflection and
awareness. Readings, discussions,  research, creative exercises and writing
constitute the body of this course.

## Teaching & Learning Methodology 

This course will be a discussion-based seminar class. A philosophy of critical
pedagogy, which encourages students to be active participants in the delivery,
dialogue, and direction of the course material, is key in this course.
Throughout the  semester, students will be expected to challenge, debate,
contextualize, and steer  the course material in personal and meaningful
directions. Short lectures, critical  discussion, and student presentations
make up the majority of class time. Assignments will consist primarily of
reading, collaborative creative practice, online  interaction, and oral
presentations. Dialogue, class participation, and documentation  will serve as
the key measures for comprehension and evaluation.


## Structure 

This class is divided into six thematic modules plus the final project. Each
thematic module consists of four portions occupying one class session each:
- a. Lecture
- b. Discussion (about the lecture) + Group formation and ideation session
- c. In-class discussion and contextualization of assigned readings + Group
  work  session + feedback
- d. Presentation and critique of group creative activity

The themes are (in sequential order):
1. Algorithms - On Randomness + Chance Machine Collaboration 
2. Interactivity
3. Machine Art
4. Net Art and Post-Internet Art
5. Environment and Spatial Art
6. Affect and Biofeedback
7. Final Projects

## Graded Activities

| Participation | 15% | Weekly | all |


### Due dates
- Work submitted up to three days late will be deducted 1 point per day
- work more than three days late will be accepted at the discretion of the
  professor and will be deducted 1 point per day from the original due date


### Description of Graded ACtivities

### Thematic Modules: readings, responses, activities 
Every thematic module will have a lecture on Day 1 (a). Day 2 (b) of the
section will  consist of discussion about the lecture in class followed by
assigning groups to work  on collaborative creative projects. On day 3 (c) of
the section a discussion about the assigned readings will be held followed by
students working collaboratively on the  assigned project. On day 4 (d) of the
section student groups come to class with work  prepared for presentation and
critique.

### Participation
- Engaging in class discussions and offering advice, input, feedback, etc
  during class is a major part of your grade.
- Laptops should only be used when necessary for class work and cell phones
  should be set to silent.
- You are expected to present your work in class and provide feedback to your
  fellow students.
- Ask questions. If you do not ask questions, I can only assume you understand
  the material completely.
- Students will receive feedback on their participation in-class (e.g. verbal
  warning of inappropriate laptop use) as well as through a provisional grade
  for participation half-way through the course.

#### Rubric

| Participation | Excellent | Good | Satisfactory | Marginal | Unsatisfactory |
| Rubric | 5 points | 4 | 3 | 2 | 0 |
| ------ | -------- | - | - | - | - |
| - Pays active attention - contributes during lectures, discussion, and activities | Regularly participates in discussion, brings in points from the reading and from own experience, listens actively to other students and responds to their comments. | As "Excellent" but with minor areas for improvement, for example paying closer attention in class and contributing more to class discussions. | Semi-regularly participates in discussion (e.g.  every other class), actively listens to other students, and sometimes responds to their comments. | Often lacking in participation, for example by not contributing to discussions, paying attention to laptop / phone, etc. | Does not actively participate or causes disturbances to the class.|

Total / 5 points = 15% of final grade

### Reading Reflections

- Class readings require a response to be submitted via Brightspace.
- Your response should be at least a full paragraph (200 words) and should
  reference the readings material directly. Come to class prepared to discuss.
- Please go through the Guidelines for a writing a Reading Reflection.
- Each graded reading listed in the Weekly Schedule is worth 5 points and
  together they count for 20% of the final grade.

#### Rubric

(TBA)

### Group Activities

- Each Thematic Module has a graded collaborative group activity. Details in the
Weekly Schedule below.
- Each graded group activity listed in the Weekly Schedule is worth 10 points and
together they count for 35% of the final grade

#### Rubric

(TBA)

### Final Project: Exhibition 
Drawing on the concepts, art history, questions and discussions from the
course, in  groups of 4 students, students will develop an original concept
for an exhibition of  "interactive media" in a selected venue/gallery/location
in the UAE.  

Come up with: 
- A title 
- A curatorial theme and statement 
- A selected venue/gallery/location in the UAE for installing the artists’ work. 
- Each student should select an artist that we looked at to embody, carefully
  research their entire body of work, and extract from their ethos, thinking,
  artistic  positions to come up with a new concept that propagates the
  essence of the  selected artists and fit the overall concept/theme of the
  exhibition.
- Each artwork in the exhibition needs to use different media, and fall under
  one  of our course’s thematic modules.  
- The exhibition should be a group show that comes together in harmony under
  the main umbrella of the exhibition (i.e. not a solo retrospective).  
- Students are free to express the design and concept of your exhibition in
  whichever  way you see fitting to present to class. That could be in digital
  format using a pre existing platform for exhibits or designing your own.
  This could be in the format of still or video renderings/visualizations/3D
  environments/collaged digital images etc. There needs to be a visual of the
  overall exhibition within the selected venue/location showcasing all of the
  exhibits.  

#### Final project submission requirements: 
1. A catalog documenting the show. The catalogue should have a curatorial
essay  of at least 1 page (300 words) describing the critical and conceptual
framing of the  exhibit. It should draw on themes and modes of analysis we
have discussed in  class. The catalogue should also contain one page (minimum)
for each included  artist with an image of their work, a label for the artwork
including the title, date and  materials, along with a short description of
who the artist is, what the artwork is and  its concept, and why it connects
to the curatorial theme. 
2. A presentation to present the final project in class as a group. All
students should  have a turn talking about the exhibition and their
contribution to the project. Develop  at least two prompts for class
conversation. They will have about 20 minutes to  present their work and
engage the class in Q&A.  

#### Rubric

(TBA)


### Final Grade Calculation

| Letter Grade | Minimum Percentage | 
| --- | --- | 
| A | 100 - 95 |
| A- | 94 - 90 |
| B+ | 89 - 87 |
| B | 86 - 83 |
| B- | 82 - 80 |
| C+ | 79 - 77 |
| C | 76 - 73 |
| C- | 72 - 70 |
| D+ | 69 - 67 |
| D | 66 - 63 |
| F | 62 - 0 |
Scores will be rounded up at precisely .5, so 89.5 becomes 90 but 89.49 does not.

### Group Activity:
- "In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work.
When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning
and decisions are made beforehand, and the execution is a perfunctory affair.
The idea becomes a machine that makes the art."
Sol Lewitt, Paragraphs on Conceptual Art, Art Forum, 1967
- **In small groups (two or max three) - create a work of conceptual art based on
Randomness, Chance and Algorithm in any medium. It can be digital, physical,
performance, sound... any artistic form you choose and document it in a
presentation format.**
- **The work should start with a clear concept and consist of a series of rules or
steps such that the concept/algorithm is the work of art, and the outcome is a
document of process - a "perfunctory affair".**
- Your documentation should:
    - Be a presentation (around 10mins) (can be attached or if too
      large/issues with uploading, you can add a link to a shared document,
      make sure I can access it)
    - Include everyone's names.
    - Provide a title and paragraph description of the work including the
      concept and algorithm.
    - Mention at least one artist we have read or discussed who is providing
      inspiration for this work.
    - Contain images, video or sound recording to convey the experience of the
      work.
    - Pay close attention to the design of the presentation itself, make sure
      it communicates the idea effectively, considers aesthetics, speaks to
      the concept you are conveying.
    - Conclude the presentation with key prompts for conversation about your
      idea/piece, steer the conversation in a way that is meaningful for you.
      What do you want feedback on?
- **Prepare to show in class for critique and upload your presentation to
Brightspace. (Each member of the group should upload their group’s
presentation on their Brightspace).**

### Group Activity:
**Drawing on readings and class discussions, make a piece of internet-based art.
This can be literally using the internet as a medium or responding to the
internet in another way, as we saw in "post-internet" art.
Describe which art works and ideas from the class materials inspired your piece
in your documentation.**

- Your documentation should:
    - Be a presentation (around 10mins) (can be attached or if too
      large/issues with uploading, you can add a link to a shared document,
      make sure I can access it)
    - Include everyone's names.
    - Provide a title and paragraph description of the work including the
      concept.
    - Mention at least one artist we have read or discussed who is providing
      inspiration for this work.
    - Contain images, video or sound recording to convey the experience of the
      work.
    - Pay close attention to the design of the presentation itself, make sure
      it communicates the idea eﬀectively, considers aesthetics, speaks to the
      concept you are conveying.
    - Conclude the presentation with key prompts for conversation about your
      idea/piece, steer the conversation in a way that is meaningful for you.
      What do you want feedback on?
- Prepare to show in class for critique and upload your presentation to
  Brightspace. (Each member of the group should upload their group’s
  presentation on their Brightspace).
