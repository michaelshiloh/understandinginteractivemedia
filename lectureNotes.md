### Thursday August 28 Week 1

#### Administration
- I'll be gone next week!

#### Conceptual art 

Formalism: a focus on formal properties of an artwork
* What the artwork looks like, what materials it's made of

Modernism
* Late 19th, early 20th-century movement in literature, visual arts,
  performing arts, and music that emphasized experimentation, abstraction, and
  subjective experience.
* Emerged in response to significant changes in Western culture, including
  secularization and the growing influence of science.
* Rejects  the concept of absolute originality upheld in the 19th century by
  both realism and Romanticism, replacing it with techniques of collage,
  incorporation, rewriting, revision, and parody.

Avant-garde
* "Advance guard"
* Identifies the artists and writers whose innovations in style, form,
  and subject-matter push the aesthetic boundaries of societal norms
    * Societal norms represent a "dumbing down", and must be
      constantly challenged
* Includes a great many types such as Cubism, Dadaism, Expressionism,
  Fluxus, Impressionism, Suprematism, etc.
* Early to mid 20th century

Dadaism
* 1915/16-1924
* Strongly political
    * a protest against bourgeois nationalist and colonialist interests, which
      many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war
    * also against cultural and intellectual conformity — in art and more
      broadly in society — that corresponded to the war

Fountain (Duchamp)
* regarded by art historians and theorists of the avant-garde as a major
  landmark in 20th-century art. 

Readymades
* as an antidote to what he called "retinal art"
* Is he also poking fun at art lovers, museum goers, and collectors?


Conceptual Art
* Emerged as a movement 1960s
* Reaction against modernism and ideas of formalism
* the concept(s) or idea(s) are equal to or more important
  than traditional aesthetic, technical, and material concerns. 
* Forward looking, experimental art movement; progressive,
  revolutionary, changing what art is and means
* Duchamp's readymades can be considered prototypical conceptual artworks
* Reaction against the commodification of art; it attempted a subversion of
  the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art
  market as the owner and distributor of art.


Mierle Ukeles
* Activist art?

Procedural art

Sol LeWitt
* was seminal in establishing the notion of ‘Conceptual art’ during the 1960s.
* With the exception of his very first wall drawing exhibited at the Paula
  Cooper Gallery in New York in 1968, the artist did not execute the wall
  drawings himself;
* #1136 is in Tate Modern

Algorithmic art
* Muhammad ibn Mūsa al-Khwarizmī, an influential 9th century scholar,
  astronomer, geographer, and mathematician known especially for his
  contributions to the study of algebra. 

The Latinization of his name, ‘Algoritmi’ gave English the word algorithm.

- Lecture and discussion: Machine Art

#### Machine Art

##### Machine Art in the Twentieth Century

““Machine art” is neither a movement nor a genre; rather, the term encompasses
diverse ways in which artists engage with technical systems. “

““Machine art"—namely, as those artistic works and practices that implicitly
or explicitly articulate the relation between subjects and machines”

Andreas Broeckmann, *Machine Art in the Twentieth Century*
(an overview of the vague terrain of “machine art”, various definitions of 
"machine" and "machine aesthetics")

Think about how you would define *machine art* as we go along

##### Machine Art exhibition at MOMA (1934)

The notion that machine-made objects have aesthetic value has been with us for
some time, dating back to avant-garde movements of the early 20th century such
as Futurism, which influenced other schools, including the Bauhaus and De
Stijl (focused on geometric abstraction and lack of ornamentation).  However,
the idea that a museum would display a propeller or a vacuum cleaner as a work
of art was startling to many in 1934.

Visitors to *Machine Art* were startled to find three floors of utilitarian,
machine-made objects, such as springs, pots and pans, and scientific
instruments, displayed on pedestals, elevating them to the level of sculpture.

- A major figure of the experimental Fluxus movement 
    - (Fluxus was an international, interdisciplinary community of artists,
      composers, designers and poets during the 1960s and 1970s who engaged in
      experimental art performances which emphasized the artistic process over
      the finished product.)
- Nam June Paik is considered the father of video art. His most famous
  sculptures feature real TV sets. He co-invented a video synthesizer using
  analog electronics
- Paik’s practice—which combined music, performance, technology, and
  film—explored the possibilities of mass media and emerging technologies with
  impressive foresight.  
- Coining the term “electronic superhighway” in the 1970s, Paik wrote of a
  near future in which new media technologies would connect populations
  through global networks; in a sense, he predicted the internet. 

- The concept of the robot came from Paik wanting to create a robot for
  impromptu street performances that create a “sudden show” or “split-second
  surprise”.  
- Salvaged, junk, and household materials.  This reflected what would become a
  staple of his artwork, repurposing cheap and disposable materials into brand
  new technologies.  


#####  Edward Ihnatowicz 'The Senster'

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7ZMRqyTWU)

- Edward Ihnatowicz (1926 -1988) was a cybernetic sculptor who explored
  interactivity between his robotic works and the audience
- The Senster was a 4 meter tall robot, commissioned by Dutch electronics
  manufacturer Philips to be on show at the Evoluon, its exhibition space
  dedicated to science and technology in Eindhoven. 
- It was one of the first computer controlled robotic works of art and could
  be visited between 1970-1974 in the entrance hall gallery of the Evoluon. 
- The work consisted of a steel skeleton, with a resemblance to a dinosaur or
  a giraffe with its long neck. 
- The ‘beast’ reacted to sound and movement made by the visitors. 
- Its two legs remained immobile and connected to the ground, but its neck and
  head moved and could follow people around the room.
- There were three different movement responses built into the robot: 
    - gentle sounds would make its head move toward the visitor, 
    - loud sounds would make the head pull back, 
    - and when a visitor performed fast movements the robot would follow
      these. 
- Spectators reacted with great enthusiasm to the robot.
