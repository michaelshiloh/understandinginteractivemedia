#### Conceptual art 

Formalism: a focus on formal properties of an artwork
* What the artwork looks like, what materials it's made of

Modernism
* Late 19th, early 20th-century movement in literature, visual arts,
  performing arts, and music that emphasized experimentation, abstraction, and
  subjective experience.
* Emerged in response to significant changes in Western culture, including
  secularization and the growing influence of science.
* Rejects  the concept of absolute originality upheld in the 19th century by
  both realism and Romanticism, replacing it with techniques of collage,
  incorporation, rewriting, revision, and parody.

Avant-garde
* "Advance guard"
* Identifies the artists and writers whose innovations in style, form,
  and subject-matter push the aesthetic boundaries of societal norms
    * Societal norms represent a "dumbing down", and must be
      constantly challenged
* Includes a great many types such as Cubism, Dadaism, Expressionism,
  Fluxus, Impressionism, Suprematism, etc.
* Early to mid 20th century

Dadaism
* 1915/16-1924
* Strongly political
    * a protest against bourgeois nationalist and colonialist interests, which
      many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war
    * also against cultural and intellectual conformity — in art and more
      broadly in society — that corresponded to the war

Fountain (Duchamp)
* regarded by art historians and theorists of the avant-garde as a major
  landmark in 20th-century art. 

Readymades
* as an antidote to what he called "retinal art"
* Is he also poking fun at art lovers, museum goers, and collectors?


Conceptual Art
* Emerged as a movement 1960s
* Reaction against modernism and ideas of formalism
* the concept(s) or idea(s) are equal to or more important
  than traditional aesthetic, technical, and material concerns. 
* Forward looking, experimental art movement; progressive,
  revolutionary, changing what art is and means
* Duchamp's readymades can be considered prototypical conceptual artworks
* Reaction against the commodification of art; it attempted a subversion of
  the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art
  market as the owner and distributor of art.


Mierle Ukeles
* Activist art?

Procedural art

Sol LeWitt
* was seminal in establishing the notion of ‘Conceptual art’ during the 1960s.
* With the exception of his very first wall drawing exhibited at the Paula
  Cooper Gallery in New York in 1968, the artist did not execute the wall
  drawings himself;
* #1136 is in Tate Modern

Algorithmic art
* Muhammad ibn Mūsa al-Khwarizmī, an influential 9th century scholar,
  astronomer, geographer, and mathematician known especially for his
  contributions to the study of algebra. 

The Latinization of his name, ‘Algoritmi’ gave English the word algorithm.
