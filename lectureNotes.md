### Thursday August 28 Week 1
- Module 1: Conceptual Art, Procedural Art, Algorithms, Programmable Objects

#### Administration
- I'll be gone next week!

#### Conceptual art 

Formalism: a focus on formal properties of an artwork
* What the artwork looks like, what materials it's made of

Modernism
* Late 19th, early 20th-century movement in literature, visual arts,
  performing arts, and music that emphasized experimentation, abstraction, and
  subjective experience.
* Emerged in response to significant changes in Western culture, including
  secularization and the growing influence of science.
* Rejects  the concept of absolute originality upheld in the 19th century by
  both realism and Romanticism, replacing it with techniques of collage,
  incorporation, rewriting, revision, and parody.

Avant-garde
* "Advance guard"
* Identifies the artists and writers whose innovations in style, form,
  and subject-matter push the aesthetic boundaries of societal norms
    * Societal norms represent a "dumbing down", and must be
      constantly challenged
* Includes a great many types such as Cubism, Dadaism, Expressionism,
  Fluxus, Impressionism, Suprematism, etc.
* Early to mid 20th century

Dadaism
* 1915/16-1924
* Strongly political
    * a protest against bourgeois nationalist and colonialist interests, which
      many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war
    * also against cultural and intellectual conformity — in art and more
      broadly in society — that corresponded to the war

Fountain (Duchamp)
* regarded by art historians and theorists of the avant-garde as a major
  landmark in 20th-century art. 

Readymades
* as an antidote to what he called "retinal art"
* Is he also poking fun at art lovers, museum goers, and collectors?


Conceptual Art
* Emerged as a movement 1960s
* Reaction against modernism and ideas of formalism
* the concept(s) or idea(s) are equal to or more important
  than traditional aesthetic, technical, and material concerns. 
* Forward looking, experimental art movement; progressive,
  revolutionary, changing what art is and means
* Duchamp's readymades can be considered prototypical conceptual artworks
* Reaction against the commodification of art; it attempted a subversion of
  the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art
  market as the owner and distributor of art.


Mierle Ukeles
* Activist art?

Procedural art

Sol LeWitt
* was seminal in establishing the notion of ‘Conceptual art’ during the 1960s.
* With the exception of his very first wall drawing exhibited at the Paula
  Cooper Gallery in New York in 1968, the artist did not execute the wall
  drawings himself;
* #1136 is in Tate Modern

Algorithmic art
* Muhammad ibn Mūsa al-Khwarizmī, an influential 9th century scholar,
  astronomer, geographer, and mathematician known especially for his
  contributions to the study of algebra. 

The Latinization of his name, ‘Algoritmi’ gave English the word algorithm.

#### Machine Art

##### Machine Art in the Twentieth Century

““Machine art” is neither a movement nor a genre; rather, the term encompasses
diverse ways in which artists engage with technical systems. “

““Machine art"—namely, as those artistic works and practices that implicitly
or explicitly articulate the relation between subjects and machines”

Andreas Broeckmann, *Machine Art in the Twentieth Century*
(an overview of the vague terrain of “machine art”, various definitions of 
"machine" and "machine aesthetics")

Q: Think about how you would define *machine art* as we go along

##### Machine Art exhibition at MOMA (1934)

Pictures
[here](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1784?installation_image_index=0)

The notion that machine-made objects have aesthetic value has been with us for
some time, dating back to avant-garde movements of the early 20th century such
as Futurism, which influenced other schools, including the Bauhaus and De
Stijl (focused on geometric abstraction and lack of ornamentation).  However,
the idea that a museum would display a propeller or a vacuum cleaner as a work
of art was startling to many in 1934.

Visitors to *Machine Art* were startled to find three floors of utilitarian,
machine-made objects, such as springs, pots and pans, and scientific
instruments, displayed on pedestals, elevating them to the level of sculpture.

The machine as art vs. the machine as something that makes art

Q: How would you critique or review this exhibition?

##### Robot K-456 (Nam June Paik) 1964

- A major figure of the experimental Fluxus movement 
    - (Fluxus was an international, interdisciplinary community of artists,
      composers, designers and poets during the 1960s and 1970s who engaged in
      experimental art performances which emphasized the artistic process over
      the finished product.)
- Nam June Paik is considered the father of video art. His most famous
  sculptures feature real TV sets. He co-invented a video synthesizer using
  analog electronics
- Paik’s practice—which combined music, performance, technology, and
  film—explored the possibilities of mass media and emerging technologies with
  impressive foresight.  
- Coining the term “electronic superhighway” in the 1970s, Paik wrote of a
  near future in which new media technologies would connect populations
  through global networks; in a sense, he predicted the internet. 

- The ide for the robot came from Paik wanting to create a robot for
  impromptu street performances that create a “sudden show” or “split-second
  surprise”.  
- Salvaged, junk, and household materials.  This reflected what would become a
  staple of his artwork, repurposing cheap and disposable materials into brand
  new technologies.  

Q: What does the use of salvaged items, junk, and household materials say
about beauty and aesthetics?

#####  Edward Ihnatowicz 'The Senster'

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7ZMRqyTWU)

- Edward Ihnatowicz (1926 -1988) was a cybernetic sculptor who explored
  interactivity between his robotic works and the audience
- The Senster was a 4 meter tall robot, commissioned by Dutch electronics
  manufacturer Philips to be on show at the Evoluon, its exhibition space
  dedicated to science and technology in Eindhoven. 
- It was one of the first computer controlled robotic works of art and could
  be visited between 1970-1974 in the entrance hall gallery of the Evoluon. 
- The work consisted of a steel skeleton, with a resemblance to a dinosaur or
  a giraffe with its long neck. 
- The ‘beast’ reacted to sound and movement made by the visitors. 
- Its two legs remained immobile and connected to the ground, but its neck and
  head moved and could follow people around the room.
- There were three different movement responses built into the robot: 
    - gentle sounds would make its head move toward the visitor, 
    - loud sounds would make the head pull back, 
    - and when a visitor performed fast movements the robot would follow
      these. 
- Spectators reacted with great enthusiasm to the robot.

"Telling a story in a powerful way"

[About](https://srl.org/?location=about.html)


Q:
- Is it spectacle or art? Can it be both? 
- An experience people don't usually get
- Is it interactive?
- Is it [sublime](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/s/sublime)

"The theory of sublime art was put forward by Edmund Burke in A Philosophical
Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful published in
1757. He defined the sublime as an artistic effect productive of the strongest
emotion the mind is capable of feeling. He wrote ‘whatever is in any sort
terrible or is conversant about terrible objects or operates in a manner
analogous to terror, is a source of the sublime’."

#####  Rebecca Horn

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtrQtrF51Xg)

- Rebecca Horn (1944 - 2024) is a German visual artist 
- best known for her installation art, film directing, and her body
  modifications with body suits.
- Horn describes the machines “have a soul because they act, shake,
  tremble, faint, almost fall apart, and then come back to life again. They
  are not perfect machine (…) I’m interested in the soul of a thing, not the
  machine itself."
- While often constructed with technical precision using hard, cold materials,
  Horn‘s works – in concert with their temporal spacing and ritualistic
  movements – are emotive and sensual, often striking a balance between
  aggression and tenderness.

Q: This balance between aggression and tenderness - do you see this in the
other machine artists?

#####  Arthur Ganson

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__GhJl_UQg0&list=PLTclenKfUcZirva6j_Jc-YWzOlmNRdPmk)

- Arthur Ganson (born 1955) is a kinetic sculptor, inventor and musician
- He makes mechanical art demonstrations with existential themes..
- Ganson describes his work as a cross between mechanical engineering and
  choreography.
- His sculptures have been called "gestural, playful, humorous, evocative, and
  introspective
- Ganson admits that he has been strongly influenced by the likes of such
  Dadaists as Marcel Duchamp and Jean Tinguely.
- Delicate assemblages of interconnecting gears, springs, cams, ratchets and
  sprockets fashioned out of spot-welded bailing wire perform whimsical acts
  with mostly found objects.
- From a distance his sculptures, which are sometimes hand-cranked and
  sometimes motorized, have a homespun 19th century quality.
- They could be absurdist wire doodles.
- Closer up, the movement and gesture implicit in his work becomes strangely
  hypnotic — often humorous, childlike, introspective, and existential.

Q: - How is this work existential?

"I love to solve problems, ... but the end result is ambiguous"o

Found objects - visual puns

The fleetingness of the present moment

"What would I love if I were a machine - I would love to be bathed in oil"

Arthur Ganson at
[TED](https://www.ted.com/talks/arthur_ganson_moving_sculpture)

"All of these pieces start off in my own mind in my heart and I do my best at
finding ways to express them with materials ... somehow I manage to get this
thought out into the object ... the object itself means nothing once it is
perceived and someone else brings it into their mind then a cycle has been
completed ... I've always wanted to communicate my passion, my love, and that
means the complete cycle of coming from inside out to someone perceiving it"

Arthur Ganson at the [Long Now
Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyCyFe9QFrw)

"In order for a piece to have any meaning to anyone, they create the meaning
If you feel a connection to anything then it's not really in the piece, it's
in you, and it's all about your experience"

Hearts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyCyFe9QFrw&t=3774)

##### Peter Flemming

[Video](https://peterflemming.ca/works/smc)

- Peter Flemming is a full-time artist, part-time professor and some-time
  curator in Montréal who exhibits and works internationally.
- Research interests include ad hoc architecture, intuitive physics, informal
  engineering, solar power, and waste harvest.
- Flemming's work considers natural and technological ecologies, in
  site-specific projects that are resolved intuitively and experimentally.
- “Technological systems for interpreting and shaping desire texture daily
  life; a means to rationally orchestrate the world. Might not there be a need
  for systems which irrationally de-orchestrate?”
- His works like the Canoe dramatically demonstrates that functionality and
  utility are not necessarily synonymous.: Functionality here is a constant -
  complex mechanics running continuously - whereas utility is a widely
  swinging variable.
- Artist statement: My principal aim is to build systems I do not fully
  understand, with the intention of attempting to understand them.
  Technological systems for interpreting and shaping desire texture daily

Detailed [story](https://www.reubenmargolin.com/waves/contours/) of one
particular sculpture

For the last 20 years I’ve been making kinetic sculptures that seek to combine
the sensuousness of nature with the logic of math. My studio is in a yellow
warehouse in Emeryville, California, a stone’s throw from the San Francisco
Bay. During a typical day I often find myself moving in a circular arc:
beginning, perhaps, with the memory of light on the ocean and the feel of
wind, later being pulled into an irresistible problem involving sine curves,
then leaning toward the drafting table to consider proportion, thread pitch,
and color, pausing at the metal lathe to make a precision part, drilling
countless holes in a piece of wood, always working toward the unparalleled
excitement of switching on a sculpture for the very first time.

Q: Do you find this work calming? meditative?
